# JDCC-Contest-Problems
Contest problems that I have written for the Janice Dyke Computing Competition hosted for William Lyon Mackenzie CI.

In each problem folder, you will find the following files:
 * A.docx
 * A.pdf
 * A.in
 * A.out
 * A-solution.cpp
 * A-solution.exe
 * A-generator.cpp
 * A-generator.exe
 
 Generator should be run with arguments [seed] [# of test cases].
 Feel free to contact me if you have questions!
